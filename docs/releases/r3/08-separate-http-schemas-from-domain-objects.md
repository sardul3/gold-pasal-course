# Separate HTTP schemas from domain objects


## See the idea first

## Build the public contract

HTTP schemas speak JSON compatibility; domain objects protect Decimal, Weight, and Purity invariants. Separate mapping prevents an optional API field from weakening the domain.

<ApiWorkbench />

## Write the failing contract first

Write a red mapping test: request `5.20` becomes Decimal-backed Weight and 22 becomes Purity. Add a route test proving internal audit fields do not leak in response JSON.

<TestMatrix unit="boundary and domain rules" slice="HTTPX against FastAPI" integration="course checks/r3 public contract" />

## Walk the public result

A request crosses routing, transport validation, domain mapping, service/repository work, and response serialization. Name the first boundary that disagrees with your prediction before changing code.

<PredictThenRun prompt="What exact status, media type, and JSON shape should this request produce?">

Record the prediction first. For invalid karat 19, expect 422 and `application/problem+json`; valid values are 14, 18, 22, and 24.

</PredictThenRun>

## Practice

Change one input or contract assertion, predict the observable result, and run the narrow HTTPX check. Do not add authentication, a database, or a solved application.

## Worked reasoning and public evidence

Keep the red failure, green HTTPX output, relevant `/openapi.json` excerpt, and one curl transcript. Explain what they prove and what remains outside R3.

## Check

```bash
uv run pytest tests/http -q
```

Read the command’s exit status and one meaningful value in its output. A green
command is necessary evidence, but you must still be able to explain why it
protects this store behavior.
