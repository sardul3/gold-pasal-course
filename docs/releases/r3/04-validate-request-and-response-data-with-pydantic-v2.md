# Validate request and response data with Pydantic v2


## See the idea first

## Build the public contract

Pydantic validates untrusted JSON and serializes responses; it does not replace domain value objects. Define SKU, name, metal, supported karat, and positive decimal-string weight. Keep `5.20` exact instead of routing it through binary float.

<ApiWorkbench />

## Write the failing contract first

Post 19K first and require 422 Problem Details. Post a 22K ring and require declared response fields. Only then implement boundary models and map to domain values.

<TestMatrix unit="boundary and domain rules" slice="HTTPX against FastAPI" integration="course checks/r3 public contract" />

## Walk the public result

A request crosses routing, transport validation, domain mapping, service/repository work, and response serialization. Name the first boundary that disagrees with your prediction before changing code.

<PredictThenRun prompt="What exact status, media type, and JSON shape should this request produce?">

Record the prediction first. For invalid karat 19, expect 422 and `application/problem+json`; valid values are 14, 18, 22, and 24.

</PredictThenRun>

## Practice

Change one input or contract assertion, predict the observable result, and run the narrow HTTPX check. Do not add authentication, a database, or a solved application.

## Worked reasoning and public evidence

Keep the red failure, green HTTPX output, relevant `/openapi.json` excerpt, and one curl transcript. Explain what they prove and what remains outside R3.

## Check

```bash
uv run pytest tests/http -q
```

Read the command’s exit status and one meaningful value in its output. A green
command is necessary evidence, but you must still be able to explain why it
protects this store behavior.
