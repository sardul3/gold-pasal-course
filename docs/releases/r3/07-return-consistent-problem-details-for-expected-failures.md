# Return consistent Problem Details for expected failures


## See the idea first

## Build the public contract

Problem Details is the standard error document with `type`, `title`, `status`, and `detail`, served as `application/problem+json`. It gives clients one shape and must not expose stack traces.

<ApiWorkbench />

## Write the failing contract first

Write red tests for 19K and duplicate SKU. Assert status, media type, required fields, and safe detail before exception mapping. Keep validation and conflict statuses distinct.

<TestMatrix unit="boundary and domain rules" slice="HTTPX against FastAPI" integration="course checks/r3 public contract" />

## Walk the public result

A request crosses routing, transport validation, domain mapping, service/repository work, and response serialization. Name the first boundary that disagrees with your prediction before changing code.

<PredictThenRun prompt="What exact status, media type, and JSON shape should this request produce?">

Record the prediction first. For invalid karat 19, expect 422 and `application/problem+json`; valid values are 14, 18, 22, and 24.

</PredictThenRun>

## Practice

Change one input or contract assertion, predict the observable result, and run the narrow HTTPX check. Do not add authentication, a database, or a solved application.

## Worked reasoning and public evidence

Keep the red failure, green HTTPX output, relevant `/openapi.json` excerpt, and one curl transcript. Explain what they prove and what remains outside R3.

## Check

```bash
uv run pytest tests/http -q
```

Read the command’s exit status and one meaningful value in its output. A green
command is necessary evidence, but you must still be able to explain why it
protects this store behavior.
