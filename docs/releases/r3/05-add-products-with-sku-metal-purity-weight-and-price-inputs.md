# Add products with SKU, metal, purity, weight, and price inputs


## See the idea first

## Build the public contract

POST `/api/catalog/items` creates a resource. SKU is public identity; metal, karat, and weight describe it. Do not trust a client-computed selling total: domain pricing owns that decision.

<ApiWorkbench />

## Write the failing contract first

First post `GP-RING-001`, gold, 22K, `5.20`; require 201. Add a duplicate-SKU failing test and choose its Problem Details status before implementing persistence behavior.

<TestMatrix unit="boundary and domain rules" slice="HTTPX against FastAPI" integration="course checks/r3 public contract" />

## Walk the public result

A request crosses routing, transport validation, domain mapping, service/repository work, and response serialization. Name the first boundary that disagrees with your prediction before changing code.

<PredictThenRun prompt="What exact status, media type, and JSON shape should this request produce?">

Record the prediction first. For invalid karat 19, expect 422 and `application/problem+json`; valid values are 14, 18, 22, and 24.

</PredictThenRun>

## Practice

Change one input or contract assertion, predict the observable result, and run the narrow HTTPX check. Do not add authentication, a database, or a solved application.

## Worked reasoning and public evidence

Keep the red failure, green HTTPX output, relevant `/openapi.json` excerpt, and one curl transcript. Explain what they prove and what remains outside R3.

## Check

```bash
uv run pytest tests/http -q
```

Read the command’s exit status and one meaningful value in its output. A green
command is necessary evidence, but you must still be able to explain why it
protects this store behavior.
